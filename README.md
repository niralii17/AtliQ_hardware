## Project Summary

AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in computer hardware and peripherals with branches across India, faced difficulties in understanding their sales performance. The Sales Director was concerned about declining sales and had trouble interpreting data from Excel files. Regional managers also struggled with reporting sales status effectively.

- Step 5: Developed necessary measures and created visuals in Power BI.
- Step 6: Standardized various currencies into a unified currency type for consistency.
- Step 7: Validated the accuracy and integrity of the data.
- Step 8: Designed and implemented data models and visualizations to convey insights effectively
